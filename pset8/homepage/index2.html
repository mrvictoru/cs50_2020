                <p>However, it is actually diffcult for engineer to predict exactly when the system would complete a certain action. <br>
                For example, when the computer is copying a file to another location. The last task could be checking for file corruption and integrity, that last action often take as long as copying the memory themselves!<br>
                Sometime, the progress bar are simply reporting a fake progress as it is performing complex task such as installing an huge program. The progress bar is simply there to indicate that "hey don't poke me I am working!"<br>
                Although being stuck at 99% is pretty annoying, without the illustration of progress will make us more frustrated when we are waiting for an action to complete.<br>
                Infact, Myers have pointed out in his research that "once people were presented by the progress bar, they relaxed and go and do other things while they patiently wait". Progress bar is actually use to comfort the user.</p>
